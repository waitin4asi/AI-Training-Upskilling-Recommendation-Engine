# AI-Training-Upskilling-Recommendation-Engine
This repository scaffold provides a runnable MVP for the 16-week roadmap you gave. It contains a minimal but functional Flask backend, a resume parser using Hugging Face, a simple recommendation engine (content + collaborative hybrid), a web scraping pipeline, and a React frontend skeleton. Use this to import into GitHub and iterate.
